# Snake
Clone of the popular snake game, written in Java. Focus on movement and responsiveness. This was one of the first game projects I worked on from a couple years ago and I am overall pleased with the result.

## Installation
There is a provided .jar file that can be used to test the game as is. Additionally, clone the repository and open project in your IDE of choice. Compile and run from Game.java

## Screenshots
Here are a couple of screenshots of the game:

## Potential Improvements
* Fonts used for score-keeping and the end game screen could be better looking
* Pause menu with option to resume, restart, or quit
* Play again option on end game screen
