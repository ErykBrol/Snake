# Snake
Remake of popular snake game, written in Java. Focus on movement and responsiveness. This was one of the first game projects I worked on from a couple years ago and I am overall pleased with the result.

## Screenshots
Here are a couple of screenshots of the game:

## Potential Improvements
* The game is a little lacking graphically, especially the fonts used for score-keeping and the end game screen
* Pause menu with option to resume, restart, or quit
* Play again option on end game screen
